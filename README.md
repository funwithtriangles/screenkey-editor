# screenkey-editor
Draw pixels for a [screenkey](https://www.screenkeys.com/). A project to help [my dad](http://www.roboticsworkshops.co.uk/) with his mad scientist projects.

Left click to draw, right click to erase. The output at the moment is just an array of on/off values but probably needs to be something a bit more useful.
